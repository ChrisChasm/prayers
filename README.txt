Lets an organization share, update, and manage prayer requests via their website. This plugin also provides JSON feeds for other services to consume and requires the WP REST API be installed and activated first.

== Description ==
Lets an organization share, update, and manage prayer requests via their website. 

Frontend (read anonymous) users can submit requests via an embeddable prayer form using the shortcode [prayer_form]. They can also click a \"pray\" button that lets the original poster know their request has been prayed for by someone else. Each request displays a count of how many times it has been prayed for. All requests can be categorized and tagged like a post.

Authorized users can track and manage prayer requests via a custom admin page. They can approve requests, mark them as answered as well as look at several other pieces of information stored with each request like geolocation data (displayable on a frontend map).

This plugin also provides JSON feeds for other services to consume and requires the [WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) be installed and activated first. You can access the Feeds through the Prayer admin menu.

== Installation ==
